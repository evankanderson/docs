# How to Get Involved

<!-- TODO: what is community, what are the touchpoints -->

## Questions

For the fastest response, you can ask questions on the [`#general`, `#serving`
or `#eventing` channels of the Knative Slack](https://slack.knative.dev/).

We also have a [Stack Overflow topic,
`knative`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/knative) (as well as
`knative-serving` and `knative-eventing`), and the
[knative-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-users) mailing
list if you prefer those formats.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Knative is composed of many different components. We use GitHub Issues to track
bug reports and feature requests. While it's most helpful if you know the
specific component that the bug is happening in, we understand that it can be
difficult to tell sometimes. A clear bug report in the wrong component is much
better than a partial report in the right component, so feel free to file your issue in these three main repositories if you're not sure:

* [Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)
* [Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/new?template=bug.md)
* [Functions](https://github.com/knative/func/issues/new)

A good bug report should include:

- What you were trying to do, and what happened
- What version of Knative and Kubernetes you are usinG (if using a cloud provider, indicate which one)
- Relevant resource yaml, HTTP requests, or log lines

## Communication Channels

Much of the community meets on [the Knative Slack](https://slack.knative.dev/).

We also have user
([`knative-users@googlegroups.com`](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-users))
and developer
([`knative-dev@googlegroups.com`](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-dev))
mailing lists for discussions, and for access to documents in the shared Google
Drive. Access to `knative-users@` is automatically approved; access to
`knative-dev@` is handled via a lightweight approval process -- it helps if you
provide a one-sentence description when requesting access.

Feature design is generally done via Google Docs stored in a [shared Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AM-QGZJ-HUA8Uk9PVA). Due to
limitations of shared drives, the default access control is that all documents
are *readable* by `knative-users@` and *commentable* and *editable* by
`knative-dev@`. Documents generally cannot be deleted without special
intervention.

We also use GitHub Issues and [GitHub
projects](https://github.com/orgs/knative/projects) for tracking longer-term
efforts, including each working group's roadmap, and the backlog for oversight
committees like the Technical Oversight Committee and the Steering Committee.

## Meetings

Knative schedules all meetings on a [shared Google
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com). Working
group leads and TOC/Steering members should have permissions to add events,
including one-off events for coordination if needed.

If you're using Google Calendar, the above should work. If you're using some
other system (Apple Calendar or Outlook, for example), [here is an iCal export
of the community
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/knative.team_9q83bg07qs5b9rrslp5jor4l6s%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

## Getting More Involved as a Contributor

If you're interested in becoming a Knative contributor, you'll want to check out
our [contributor page](./contributing.md).  **Contributing is not an
expectation** -- everyone who uses Knative, talks about it, lurks on a mailing
list, or engages with the ideas is part of our community!  If you _do_ want to
get more deeply involved, you'll find that contributing to open source can be a
great career booster as well as

## Governance
