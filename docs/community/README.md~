# How to Get Involved

<!-- TODO: what is community, what are the touchpoints -->

## Questions

For the fastest response, you can ask questions on the [`#general`, `#serving`
or `#eventing` channels of the Knative Slack](https://slack.knative.dev).

We also have a [Stack Overflow topic,
`knative`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/knative) (as well as
`knative-serving` and `knative-eventing`), and the
[knative-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-users) mailing
list if you prefer those formats.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Knative is composed of many different components. We use GitHub Issues to track
bug reports and feature requests. While it's most helpful if you know the
specific component that the bug is happening in, we understand that it can be
difficult to tell sometimes. A clear bug report in the wrong component is much
better than a partial report in the right component, so feel free to file your issue in these three main repositories if you're not sure:

* [Serving](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)
* [Eventing](https://github.com/knative/eventing/issues/new?template=bug.md)
* [Functions](https://github.com/knative/func/issues/new)
