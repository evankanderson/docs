## Contribute code samples to the community

Do you have a Knative code sample that demonstrates a use-case or product integration that will help someone learn about Knative?

Beyond the official documentation there are endless possibilities for combining tools, platforms, languages, and products. By submitting a tutorial you can share your experience and help others who are solving similar problems.

Community tutorials are stored in Markdown files under the
[`code-samples/community`](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/main/code-samples/community).
These documents are contributed, reviewed, and maintained by the community.

Submit a Pull Request to the community sample directory under the Knative component folder that aligns with your document. For example, Knative Serving samples are under the serving folder. A reviewer will be assigned to review your submission. Theyâ€™ll work with you to ensure that your submission is clear, correct, and meets the style guide, but it helps if you follow it as you write your tutorial.

- [Contribute code samples](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/main/code-samples/community):
Share your samples with the community.

- [Link existing code samples](../samples/README.md#external-code-samples):
Link to your Knative samples that live on another site.
